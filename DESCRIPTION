Minicron is a tiny starter script, which starts another program or
script after some time period.  It was optimized for size, not feature.

To compile with diet, try "make static; strip minicron"

Features are:
<br>- Start a program after it was N minutes idle

Planned extensions for future:
<br>- SIGHUP: Shutdown program now
<br>- SIGTERM: Shutdown program and terminate
<br>- Kill a program after M minutes
<br>- Maximum number of parallel processes
<br>- Start a program each N minutes
<br>- SIGUSR1: Start a program now
<br>- SIGUSR2: Start another program now
<br>- Redirect STDIN/OUT/ERR
<br>- Chroot/user/whatever before exec
<br>- Double guard (refork self).
<br>- Load DLL, fork function of DLL.
